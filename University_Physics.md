The Master in Physics capstone project entailed statistical and visualization analysis of an Utah Array dataset, depicting a patients brain activity while at rest. Primary evaluations centered upon cross-correlations of the 81 electrode sensors in an attempt to isolate human-observable patterns within the data.
  
The research and analysis employed significant Python code for result derivations.
