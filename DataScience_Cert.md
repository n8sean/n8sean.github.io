#### Course II - Methods for Data Analysis  
---
1. [Visualization of Energy Loads](https://github.com/n8sean/portfolio/blob/master/Course-02_L01_EnergyLoads.ipynb)<br/>
* Use visualization and summary statistical methods to explore a data set.
    
2. [Dataset Visualization](https://github.com/n8sean/portfolio/blob/master/Course-02_L02_Vizualization.ipynb)<br/>
* Create different complementary views of data by applying multiple chart types and aesthetics.
* Project multiple dimensions using conditioning or faceting on both categorical and numeric variables.

3. [Monty Hall Problem](https://github.com/n8sean/portfolio/blob/master/Course-02_L03_MontyHall.ipynb)<br/>
* Simulate the conditional probabilities of the distributions for winning a car vs. a goat for the Monty Hall problem.

4. [Automotive Hypothesis Testing / Automotive Dataset](https://github.com/n8sean/portfolio/blob/master/Course-02_L04_AutoHypothesis.ipynb)<br/>
* Test various hypotheses for the price of automobile features.

5. [Hypothesis Simulation / Automotive Dataset](https://github.com/n8sean/portfolio/blob/master/Course-02_L05_HypothesisSim.ipynb)<br/>
* Identify a likely distribution for price and several other features.
* Compute basic summary statistics by both classical, bootstrap, and Bayesian methods.
* Compute confidence intervals for these summary statistics by classical, bootstrap, and Bayesian methods.
* Correctly use hypothesis tests to determine if the differences in pairs and multiple populations are significant:
  + Classical tests
  + Tukeyâ€™s Honest Significant Differences (HSD)
  + Bootstrap methods
  + Bayesian model

6. [Advertising Sales Regression](https://github.com/n8sean/portfolio/blob/master/Course-02_L06_AdRegression.ipynb)<br/>
* Perform four different linear regressions on advertising sales data.
* For the first 3 linear regressions performed:
   + Produce a labeled graph showing the best fit line with the data points
   + Interpret both the slope and y-intercept
* The 4th regression includes all 3 prior features:
    + TV
    + Radio
    + Newspaper
* Interpret each partial slope and the intercept parameters.
* Interpret the adjusted R-squared.
* Find and report the mean-squared error.

7. [Parkinson PCR](https://github.com/n8sean/portfolio/blob/master/Course-02_L07_ParkinsonPCR.ipynb)<br/>
